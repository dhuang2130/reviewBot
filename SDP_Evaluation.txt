CMSI 4072 project ~ Spring 2024
Dave Huang
Code Review Assistant project
=============================================

Software Development Plan Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- General Comments
   Pretty good work here, David!  The document is a bit short on some of the
   details, but you covered the major parts.

-- Introduction Section
   In the deliverables section, the idea is to provide a list of the project
   deliverables, not just the documentation deliverables.  Since you don't
   have that anywhere else except in the Gantt chart which I can't really
   read, you should add that in.

-- Project Resources Section
   Perfect ~ no further comments, nothing to add for the second submission.

-- Project Organization Section
   Perfect ~ no further comments, nothing to add for the second submission.

-- Project Schedule Section
   I can't see the entire Gantt chart ~ the left side is cut off.

=============================================================================
your score:  9.5% out of 10% which is an A

Nice job!  Make the changes for the second submission as suggested above and
you'll get the full 10% on this document submission.

SECOND EVALUATION:

Changes made in the introduction per the comments.  Good job!  Still can't
see the left side of the Gantt chart, though....
