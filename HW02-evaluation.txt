Comments:
---------
Nice work on this assignment.

problem 5.6: you make an interesting case for classydraw, but in reality all
   the drawing needs is a single file to save it.  You can manage the files
   using the operating system.

problem 5.8: this drawing is a bit hard to follow, since you don't use any of
   the symbols that are normally used for a state diagram.

problem 6.2: again, this is hard to understand, because you aren't using any
   normal symbols.  I think I get this one, though.

Pretty good job, although it was late...
