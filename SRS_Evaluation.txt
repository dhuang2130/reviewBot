Software Requirements Specification Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- Introduction Section
   Good start for the document with this section!  Description is clear and
   cleanly defined.  A diagram of some kind would be useful but it's not
   mandatory.

-- Functional Requirements
   All requirements must be individually numbered.  Also, all requirements
   need to be individual statements.  If you see multiple sentences or the
   word "and" in a requirement, that is an indication you should split that
   statement into two or more requirements with their own numbers.

   For example:

   IS:
   5.2.1 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Integration
   The Intelligent Code Review Assistant shall integrate natural language
   processing (NLP) techniques to analyze code comments and documentation.
   The system shall parse code comments to identify relevant information
   regarding code functionality, requirements, and annotations.

   SHOULD BE:
   5.2.1 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Integration
   The Intelligent Code Review Assistant shall integrate NLP techniques to
   analyze code comments and documentation.

   5.2.1.1 The system shall parse code comments.
   5.2.1.2 The system shall identify relevant information about code
           functionality.
   5.2.1.3 The system shall identify relevant information about requirements
           from the comments
   5.2.1.4 The system shall identify relevant information about annotations
           from the comments.
           In this context, "relevant" will mean ........[whatever it means]

   In this example, the opening paragraph under section 5.2.1 is fine, with
   the exception that you have already properly identifed the acronym "NLP"
   in the section title, so you don't need to do it again.  Then under that
   paragraph, the requirements are individually numbered as shown.  You can
   gang the 'will' statement under the 'shall' statements as I did as long
   as you make sure that it's clear what the context is.

   This needs to be done with both the functional and the performance
   requirement sections.

-- Performance Requirements
   In this section [and all requirements sections] be careful of what are
   known as "weasel words", meaning ambiguous language like "acceptable"
   and "smooth user experience".  What is "acceptable to you may not be to
   me, and what is "smooth" to me may not be to Dr. Toal.  One person's
   ceiling is another person's floor.

-- Environment Requirements
   This section is perfect!  No further comments or adjustments needed.

=============================================================================
your score:  9% out of 10% which is an A-minus

All in all, not a bad first effort, you just need to fill in more specifics.

Make the changes for the second submission as suggested above, including many
more requirements  and you'll get the full 10% on this document.
