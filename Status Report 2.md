For the project Code Review Bot, I actually have a lot of the infrastructure done. I have a scoring system, a system that tells you what's wrong and why people change it to be formatted this way, and a simple ui. I now need to figure out how to design the ui to be nicer and easier to read, and format the errors to be easier for the beginner coders to read. I'm thinking of using a dictionary that basically translates an error message to an error message that is easy to read but would also like some feedback if possible.
