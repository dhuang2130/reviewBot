Total possible score: 50 points
============================================================================

Your score: 46 out of 50 = 92% which is an A-minus

Comments/feedback:

problem 7.1: what about the comments?  That's what the problem was about.  At
   least you found a couple of compile errors...

problem 7.4: the code is already offensive, since it checks its inputs

problem 7.5: Actually, no since error handling should be done in the CALLER,
   not the CALLED function.  The called function will throw an exception that
   the caller must catch and handle.

problem 8.11: The Lincoln index only uses pairs, not threes.  Therefore, you
   must calculate the index for all three pairs and average them.  The result
   is 14 bugs.

Not bad, David!

It has been a great pleasure to have you in my classes over the years, and I
look forward to hearing from you as you make your marks upon the world and the
industry.  Keep up the good work!
