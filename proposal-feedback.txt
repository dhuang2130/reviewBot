CMSI 4072 project ~ Spring 2024
Dave Huang
Code Review Assistant project
==============================

Proposal Document:
------------------
   Nice work on the document.  You make a good, although brief, description
   so that the reader gets the idea, and you follow that with a real-world
   reason for the application.  The second paragraph provides even more for
   the justification

   I agree that this tool will be useful for CS students, but having been
   in the 'industry' and having been through many code reviews, I think that
   the real usefulness of this tool could be in the greater software process
   'out there'....  An excellent project!

Proposal Presentation:
----------------------
   Nice work on the presentation.  I think this will be a very useful tool
   both for yourself, in your job, and for LMU CS students as well.  I think
   it's great that you are looking at something to improve software coding
   for consistency.  Your slides were kinda minimal ~ consider 'spicing them
   up' a bit with some graphics images.  You did a good job of talking to
   the audence not the slides, but try to focus on looking people in the eye
   so that you connect when you talk.  Good job overall!


============================================================================
your score:  5% out of 5% which is an A-plus

Great job on this presentation and proposal and great start to the semester!
