Comments:
---------

problem 1.1 and 1.2 you forgot requirements, arguably the most important one
   of the eight!  Omitting it on 1.1 probably caused your omission on 1.2 so
   only one 'ding'...

problem 4.2 the critical path should be G -> D -> E -> M -> Q taking 32 days.
   An alternative could be H -> I -> D -> E -> M -> Q which is also 32 days.

problem 4.4 this table is not a Gantt chart.  You were asked to make one of
   those to show the schedule for the project.  It appears you also are not
   allowing for specified holidays so your developers will not be happy.
   Further, your finish date is way too long because you didn't take the
   overlapping of tasks into consideration.  The project should finish on
   February 18th or 19th.

problem 5.3 although a good case could be made for your selections, actually
   the options should be categorized as:
      User: b, c, d, l, m, n, o, p
      Business: a
      Functional: b, c, d, j, k, l, m, n, o, p
      Non-functional: e, f, g, h, i
      Implementation: empty

problem 5.9 these are not actually requirments that could be added/changed.
   This is merely a description of what each category is.  You were asked
   to provide some requirements and functionality for the game that could
   then be categorized using MoSCoW.

Otherwise, good job on the assignment.  Next time, double-check the details
   of the problem statement... you'll get better, don't worry!
