Currently, the project has a functional gui system that is able to take in a file to scan through and read. The next step for the project is to create the part where the bot will be able to tell the user how the code should be formatted. That is the current step. The step after is to do an implementation of these fixes and/or a highlight of what the changes are going to be and why the code should be formatted that way.
